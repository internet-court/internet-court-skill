# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for agents working in this repository.

## What this is

The Internet Court skill package — "the trust layer for agent-to-agent
commerce". A master skill (`SKILL.md`) routes across the six-layer agentic
commerce stack to vendored protocol skills and Internet Court connector
skills. `README.md` has the stack table and layout. The repo is
self-contained: everything an agent needs ships inside it.

Published at `https://github.com/internet-court/internet-court-skill`
(public). `SKILL.md` routes to its sibling skills by repo-relative path
(`vendored/<owner>/<skill>/`, `integrations/<connector>/`); when only the
master skill is loaded, those paths resolve from the raw repo at
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/internet-court/internet-court-skill/main/<path>`.
See SKILL.md's "Where this package lives".

## Hard rules

- **Lightweight and portable.** This repo is a skill package only: no
  runnable apps, wallets, keystores, deployment scripts, or secrets. Demo
  workspaces live elsewhere, never here.
- **First-party = main skill + connectors ONLY.** The only skills written in
  this repo are `SKILL.md`, `integrations/genlayer-erc7710-connector/`,
  `integrations/genlayer-intelligent-contracts/`, and `integrations/x402-erc7710/`. Never write a new
  protocol skill here — protocol coverage must be a publicly published
  skill, vendored as a copy. If no public skill exists, ask the user; they
  will source it from the partner.
- **Never hand-edit `vendored/*`.** Vendored skills are faithful upstream
  copies (including whatever extra files upstream ships, and upstream's
  file casing — e.g. `vendored/metamask/smart-accounts-kit/skill.md` is lowercase).
  Change them only by refreshing from upstream (workflow below).
- **Vendored skills are grouped by owner.** Each one lives at
  `vendored/<owner>/<skill>/`, where `<owner>` is the publishing
  company/protocol (e.g. `vendored/metamask/smart-accounts-kit/`,
  `vendored/okx/okx-dex-swap/`, `vendored/genlayer/write-contract/`). Each
  entry's `vendoredPath` in `skills-lock.json` is the source of truth for
  where a skill lives.
- **Plain Agent Skills format** for first-party skills: a folder with a
  `SKILL.md` whose frontmatter has `name` (matching the folder) and
  `description`.
- **`references/` is local-only** (gitignored): working notes — consortium
  positioning, mandate patterns, demo runbooks. Never commit it and never
  link to it from committed files.
- **Do not commit** unless the user asks. Released versions are tagged
  (`v1`, `v2`, …).

## Updating vendored skills (new versions)

Every vendored skill is pinned in `skills-lock.json` with its `source`,
`skillPath`, `computedHash`, `fetchedAt`, and a `refreshCommand`. To update
one or all skills to the latest upstream version:

1. Run the entry's `refreshCommand` from the repo root. Most are
   `npx skills add <source>[/<path>] --agent claude-code -y && mv .claude/skills/<name> vendored/<owner>/`
   (replace the existing folder); the rest are `git clone … && cp -R …` or
   `curl …` for skills published as a bare `skill.md` URL
   (`intelligent-oracle`, `antseed-connect`).
2. Diff the new copy against the old one before accepting — upstream changes
   run with full agent permissions, so review them like third-party code.
3. Update the lock entry: recompute the hash
   (`shasum -a 256 vendored/<owner>/<name>/SKILL.md`), set `fetchedAt` to today, and
   update `sourceCommit` where present (`git rev-parse HEAD` in the clone).
   Note: entries created by the `npx skills` CLI use the CLI's own hash; the
   `hashAlgo: "sha256(SKILL.md)"` entries are plain file hashes.
4. If upstream added/removed/renamed skills, mirror that in `vendored/`,
   `skills-lock.json`, `vendored/README.md`, and the routing tables in
   `SKILL.md` and `README.md` (a skill is only discoverable if a routing row
   points at it).
5. Run the checks below, then commit and tag the next version (`v2`, `v3`,
   …) when the user asks for a release.

To add a brand-new protocol/partner skill: confirm the verified upstream
source, fetch it the same way, pin it, and add routing rows.

When relocating vendored folders (e.g. regrouping by owner), note that an
owner slug can equal a skill it contains (`chaingpt/chaingpt`, `lifi/lifi`,
`intelligent-oracle/intelligent-oracle`). Move through a temporary staging
dir outside `vendored/` so `git mv` never tries to move a folder into itself.

Validation checks before any release:

- Every first-party `SKILL.md` starts with `---`, has `name:` matching its
  folder, and a non-empty `description:`.
- `python3 -m json.tool skills-lock.json` parses; every skill folder
  (`vendored/<owner>/<name>/`) has a lock entry whose `vendoredPath` matches,
  and vice versa; `sha256(SKILL.md)` hashes match.
- Relative links in `SKILL.md` and `README.md` resolve to committed files
  (nothing may point into `references/`).

## Releasing

- Canonical home: `https://github.com/internet-court/internet-court-skill`
  (public). Local `main` tracks `origin/main`.
- The published tree is only: `SKILL.md`, `integrations/`, `vendored/`,
  `skills-lock.json`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitignore`. The gitignored
  working directories never enter the published tree — or its history.
- Keep history pristine: publish so gitignored working files have never
  existed in any pushed commit. Do not push a tag whose commit predates the
  current tree — an older tag can still contain files since removed.
- Deleting/recreating the GitHub repo requires a maintainer with org admin on
  `internet-court` plus the `gh` `delete_repo` scope
  (`gh auth refresh -h github.com -s delete_repo`).
- Tag releases (`v1`, `v2`, …) only when the user asks; run the validation
  checks first.

## Design principles

- GenLayer does not cancel ERC-7710 authority by itself: the Intelligent
  Contract produces a decision; a relayer/controller on the EVM side
  enforces it. Keep that honestly disclosed everywhere.
- Keep an absolute expiry and an emergency owner revoke as fail-safes on any
  long-lived permission.
- Treat ERC-7710/7715 as draft and implementation-dependent until the target
  wallet stack proves support.
- Testnet-first; never unlimited approvals or unbounded agent spend.
- Never claim a wallet, permission, deployment, payment, review, or relay
  exists without a proof (tx hash, address, signed artifact, receipt).

## Map

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | Master router skill — trust modes, stack table, skill routing |
| `integrations/genlayer-erc7710-connector/` | GenLayer decision → ERC-7710 revocation (relayer/controller pattern) |
| `integrations/genlayer-intelligent-contracts/` | Review rubrics, evidence schemas, decision payload interface |
| `integrations/x402-erc7710/` | x402 payments through delegated permissions (combined rail) |
| `vendored/<owner>/` | Pinned copies of official protocol skills, grouped by publisher (`skills-lock.json`) |
| `references/` | Local-only working notes (gitignored, not part of releases) |
